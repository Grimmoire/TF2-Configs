Grimmoire's TF2 Configs
=============
Configs that I've stolen from various people. Most of them have been modified by me. There's still a lot of wonkiness that needs to be buffed out. if anything goes wrong try "exec default" "exec CLASSNAME" where CLASSNAME is the name of the class you're using.
I also use several other mods and custom things, but they're not necessary. Though I highly recommend [DoodleHUD](http://doodlesstuff.com/?stuff=doodlehud)

Installation
-----------

copy these configs to
	 C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\cfg (For Windows)

	 ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf (For good operating systems)
